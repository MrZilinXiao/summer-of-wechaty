### [Project: Enhance Whatsapp Puppet #32](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/32)

We want Wechaty to be the universal instant messaging SDK on all IM platforms for chatbot makers to build their great conversational user interface, so while these are our ideas of what we think would make good projects for the summer, we're eager to hear your ideas and proposals as well.

Enhance Whatsapp Puppet <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp>. The Puppet abstraction allows Wechaty to provide a consisting API on all IM platforms for build a chatbot. We are supporting Whatsapp already, however, the Wahtsapp support is very limited. We want to implement more functions so that our developers can run their chatbots on Whatsapp to perform as much as action we can.

### [Project: Develop a WeChat chatbot for building simple personal knowledge base #44](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/44)

The project goal is to develop a WeChat chatbot which can help build simple personal knowledge base. It should be able to perform two kinds of automated tasks:

- once receiving a post share, save the post title and link to your database
- once receiving a text message, provide a list of posts related to the text

For example, if you share this post ([股票股市新手入门指南（完整版）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/108627613)) to the chatbot from zhihu(知乎) app, it will save this post and notify you of the result. You will receive a list containing this post next time you send the chatbot a text message "股票". Your backend server should be able to calculate the semantic similarity between message texts and posts.

### [Project: Wechat group-society #46](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/46)

We would like to invite you to help us create a new way of socializing on wechat where individuals and groups can easily find like-minded people/groups by subscribing to our group-society official account.

We will build up a centralized platform using our powerful [wechaty official account puppet](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-official-account) to allow individual users as well as wechat groups to subscribe to. With group users' permission, we will use our wechaty bot to collect chat messages, and analyze the topics of interest for each group via [topic modeling tools](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). The top topics of each group will be used as its 'tag' so that individual users can search for and join the groups of interest. Besides, our wechaty bot can break the boundaries between groups of similar interests by sharing messages across groups.

### [Project: github webhook transformer/deligator for IM #47](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/47)

The project's goal is create a github webhooks' transformer, after the transformation, it can make the content of those webhooks more suitable for displayed on the various IMs(wechat, facebook, whatsapp). It would be better to create a deligated hook transform service using Wechaty which can broadcast those webhook events to IM directly.

#### Background

Github has a fantastic and strong webhook system allows you build or set up integrations easily. It can be used to trigger a CI build or update a deploy on production server, it is called workflow automation. And we can not only apply webhooks to automation, if we can easily broadcast these project events (pushes, prs, issues etc.) to various channels(wechat, facebook, whatsapp), it will be very conducive to people to discuss, comment and share. As it happens, Wechaty is one such product with a lot of puppeteers support many IMs which can help people create a chat bot in an easy way.

### [Project: path analysis of conversation graphs #50](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/50)

for improving the quality of chatbots it would be great to have some analysis of conversation logs. basically plotting "routes" through the conversation.

this really needs to be connected to backend NLP, so that we can reduce down the inputs to common intents. otherwise there are just too many individual variations of patterns

so the proposal would be to see some type of "path analysis" of a conversation graph ideally we could plot this against the ideal path for comparison

if we were to use a graph database to store the conversations perhaps we could do deeper analysis for things like the "optimum route" between two nodes. or visualizing the paths for an easier way to understand them.

I have a couple of projects here that were early tests in this direction that I can share the repos of. they aren't really using graph analysis yet they are more plotting conversations as visual graphs using D3 or Cytoscape. This project would be ideally about taking this to a next level of investigation.

It should be language agnostic - we would be working with tokens of intents and creating conversation graphs that link these intents together
