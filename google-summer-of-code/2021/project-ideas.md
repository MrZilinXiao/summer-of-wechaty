# GSoC 2021 Wechaty Ideas Page

This page aggregates project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2021. See more information about this project and applications on the [Wechaty Google Summer of Code page](../).

Below you can find project ideas which have been proposed for this year. New ideas may be proposed by interested mentors or students. Project ideas without potential mentors will be considered though applicants may need to work with the community and GSoC org admins to find mentors. To add a new project idea, see: [proposing project ideas](../proposing-project-ideas.md) .

## Accepted ideas

Below you can see the list of project ideas that fully match the Jenkins' project idea standard. The scope of these ideas is well known and we don't normally expect deep changes. All ideas have quick start guidelines and newbie-frienfly issues referenced. We welcome contributors to join the mentor teams, and we invite students to submit project proposal applications in relation to these ideas.

One strategy is to leave an opening for students to propose their own original project ideas. Some great ideas can come out of this process. Emphasize that the student proposing something original must engage with the community strongly before or during the application period to get feedback and guidance to improve the proposal.

## Draft project ideas

Below you can see draft project ideas, which are currently under review. The scope of such ideas may change during the discussions, but the idea is accepted in principle. You are welcome to comment on the draft and to join the project as a mentor. If you are a student, it is also fine to explore and to apply to the draft project ideas.

## Ongoing discussion (Wishlist)

These are proposals in the [Wishlist Repo](https://github.com/wechaty/wishlist/issues) which have not been published as project ideas yet. The feasibility is yet to be defined, and the idea may be dismissed depending on the feedback. Everyone is welcome to participate in the discussion and to join as a potential mentor.

## Categories

There are many ways to define a good GSoC project–probably as many ways as there are student-mentor pairings. Here are just a few:

- **Low-hanging fruit**: These projects require minimal familiarity with the codebase and basic technical knowledge. They are relatively short, with clear goals.
- **Risky/Exploratory**: These projects push the scope boundaries of your development effort. They might require expertise in an area not covered by your current development team. They might take advantage of a new technology. There is a reasonable chance that the project might be less successful, but the potential rewards make it worth the attempt.
- **Fun/Peripheral**: These projects might not be related to the current core development focus, but create new innovations and new perspective for your project.
- **Core development**: These projects derive from the ongoing work from the core of your development team. The list of features and bugs is never-ending, and help is always welcome.
- **Infrastructure/Automation**: These projects are the code that your organization uses to get its development work done; for example, projects that improve the automation of releases, regression tests and automated builds. This is a category in which a GSoC student can be really helpful, doing work that the development team has been putting off while they focus on core development.
