### [Project: Enhance Whatsapp Puppet #32](https://github.com/wechaty/summer-of-wechaty/issues/32)

We want Wechaty to be the universal instant messaging SDK on all IM platforms for chatbot makers to build their great conversational user interface, so while these are our ideas of what we think would make good projects for the summer, we're eager to hear your ideas and proposals as well.

Enhance Whatsapp Puppet <https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp>. The Puppet abstraction allows Wechaty to provide a consisting API on all IM platforms for build a chatbot. We are supporting Whatsapp already, however, the Wahtsapp support is very limited. We want to implement more functions so that our developers can run their chatbots on Whatsapp to perform as much as action we can.
