# Proposing New Project Ideas

Wechaty is maintaining Ideas in our [wishlist](https://github.com/wechaty/wishlist) repo to continually recruit new ideas at anytime.

In order to proposing a new project idea, you need to:

1. File an issue under [wishlist repo issues](https://github.com/wechaty/wishlist/issues/) to describe what you want to propose, and mention the `@wechaty/sow` so that our team can get notified.
1. Send your new issue link url to our Gitter Chat at <https://gitter.im/wechaty/wechaty> so that more developers can see it and talk about your idea.
